    <h1>iAmbition Technology</h1>
    <h2>Empowering lives through technology</h2>

    <h3>A quick note for Gem</h3>
    <p>
        iAmbition Technology is a Taiwan company that was formed in 2020. However,
        the new company that I am involved with is going to be set up in Singapore,
        and will be called iAmbition Technology Singapore, which is a separate company.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Taiwan company will use our branding, as designed by you. There is no
        requirements for any Chinese translation. We will omit "Singapore" in the
        branding.

    <h3>Logo styling</h3>
    <div class="logos">
        <img src="https://techstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/collibra.png" alt="collibra-logo">
        <img src="https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/assets/uk/p6_gro1/p6_initial_explore/p6_initial_life-hacks/p6_initial_the-things-you-can-do-with-a-family-hub/3_MO_A_bixby_icon.png?$ORIGIN_PNG$"

    </div>



    <p>
        The above are some technology/ai related company logos, which I quite like.
        The first logo, collibra uses a lines and dots, which are very common in AI related
        graphics because of brain/neural networks. You can choose to use dots and lines, but
        it is not a requirement from our side.
        Style wise, I prefer something that is more of a modern and minimal design. It does not
        have to be very simple(example collibra), but I prefer not to have 3D effects or unnecessary
        elements that makes it too messy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also would like to put the focus on our technologies, and not on our name iAmbition,
        which does not really have any connection to what we do. I would put AI/Big data as
        our core technology, they can be grouped under 'data science'.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the name "iAmbition" should not be the focus of the logo, we are also a company does R&D
        on emerging technologies and one of our core values is to be <em>BOLD</em>, as such if possible,
        there should be some boldness in our branding. However you can consider the short
        name of our company, iAT/iATech if you want to include it in the design, but the logo should
        still reflect on data science/ai/big data.
